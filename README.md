## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, React, Tailwind, Vite

-   Used Vite to create the project with React.
-   Used tailwind for styling and speed up the process

## Optimizations

-   Add a better footer and more content
-   Add unique animations on the move of the iphone between different sizes

## Lessons Learned:

-   Improve my styling skills with CSS and tailwind
-   Used Tailwind to mimic the design from the company's official website
-   Utilized free external resources for assets that I was not able to extract from main site

## Examples:
